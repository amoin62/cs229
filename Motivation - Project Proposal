Motivation:

YouTube is an American video-sharing platform headquartered in
California. It allows users to upload, view, rate, comments and reports videos.
 As of beginning of 2017, more than 400
hours of videos are uploaded to the website every minute. One interesting and
useful feature when creating a video is the tags. In fact, the tags are the keywords
or terms used by the users to describe the video that is being uploaded. A
video containing multiple relevant tags will have a higher chance of ride up on
the first few results pages. Thus, a video without tag or using inappropriate
or irrelevant tag will have a significant impact on the number of view on the
video. This is particular true for YouTubers where their income is highly
depends on the number views of their videos.  

The dataset used are provided by www.kaggle.com(1). It includes daily data
from the most 200 trending YouTube videos in both the US and the UK. The database
contains: the Video ID, the title of the video, the title of the channel, the
Category ID, the tags the views, the likes / dislikes, the date, etc. Our goal
is to come up with the most optimal machine learning model, as suggested tools
for YouTubers, to propose some tags recommendation based on the comments or
reviews of the video.
